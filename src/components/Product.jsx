                   Agni 9 is a reusable, two-stage rocket designed and manufactured by SpaceRoot for the reliable and safe transport of people and payloads into Earth orbit and beyond. Falcon 9 is the worldâ€™s first orbital class reusable rocket. Reusability allows SpaceX to refly the most expensive parts of the rocket, which in turn drives down the cost of space access.

                   Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) is the third generation launch vehicle. The PSLV is capable of placing multiple payloads into orbit, thus multi-payload adaptors are used in the payload fairing. The payload performance of the vehicle and mission flexibility is evident from the challenging missions where multi-orbit and multi-satellite missions are accomplished.The long string of consecutive successes and multi-satellite launch capability has reinforced the status of PSLV as a reliable, versatile and affordable launcher in the global market

                        Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark II (GSLV Mk II) is the launch vehicle developed by SpaceRoot, to launch communication satellites in geo transfer orbit using cryogenic third stage. Initially Russian GK supplied cryogenic stages were used. Later cryogenic stage was indigenously developed and inducted in Jan 2014 from GSLV D5 onwards. This operational fourth generation launch vehicle is a three stage vehicle with four liquid strap-ons. The flight proven indigenously developed Cryogenic Upper Stage (CUS), forms the third stage of GSLV Mk II. From January 2021, the vehicle has achieved six consecutive successes
